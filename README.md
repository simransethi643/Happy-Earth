Problem and a reason
_First let's find out the sites where all the natural disasters are happening around the earth and how many times a year_
Wildfires happens because of heat and not enough rain. For example; in California there were wildfires for three days and within las two days; topical stome came in and help the sitution come down, and this is one of many example of natural disasters. For more information please see the database. [California's Nightmare Fire Season Continues. (n.d.).

# Solution
#### We would send drone to the site to take all the pictures and with some tools to take samples around the area as needed.
#### Second after looking at the pictures try to find a solution. 
###### For an example buld a machine that collects water from the flood locations and then take it to the area where wild fire happens and store the machine at the site.
